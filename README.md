This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles: forgetting to include the `requirements.txt` file before running `pip install`. The initial `Dockerfile` will fail to build because it tries to install packages from a missing file.  The fixed version, `Dockerfile.fixed`, corrects this by adding a `COPY` instruction to copy the file into the image before running `pip install`.  This is a simple example, but highlights a fundamental issue in Dockerfile construction where you need to ensure all necessary files are available before you try to use them.
